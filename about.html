            I was born in Poland and moved to Berlin at the age of six. Music was my passion since I can remember. For the last 20 years I was involved in different projects, playing drums, guitar, comosing and producing music. in 2015 I graduated as "Mediengestalter f√ºr Bild und Ton" at the Cimdata Medienakademie.
            As sports and Fitness is my second Hobby, I studied at the Medical Fitness Academy in Berlin and graduated with a Fitness Trainer A-licence, B-licence, Personal Trainer and nutrition consultant.
            Due to a tough market and employment chances in both, the media- and fitness industry, I chose to try a new career path and take an orientation course at DCI.  After the 4 week class I decided, that Online Marketing is the direction I want to focus on and hopefully start a new career in this genre.
